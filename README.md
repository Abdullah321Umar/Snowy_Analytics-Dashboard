# 📊 Snowy Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

## 🧠 Project Overview
I developed a visually immersive Snowy Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze global ski resort data across various continents. The dashboard delivers insights into resort distribution, skiing activities, terrain difficulty, lift infrastructure, and altitude profiles—catering to both beginner and expert skiers. The objective was to provide a comprehensive tool for tourism insights, travel planning, and slope analysis.

## 📊 Key Dashboard Metrics (KPIs)
- Total Resorts: 499
- Resorts Offering Summer Skiing: 29
- Resorts Offering Night Skiing: 204
- Child-Friendly Resorts: 495
- Countries Covered: 38
- Continents Represented: 5

## 📈 Visual Insights & Components:
### 🌐 Top 10 Countries with Most Ski Resorts:
Bar chart comparison showing that Austria, United States, and Japan top the list in terms of ski resort availability.

- 📊 Resorts for Beginners & Experts:
Line graphs show a downward trend in beginner-friendly resorts compared to a wider distribution of expert-level resorts, helping identify regional skiing difficulty levels.

- 📉 Slopes by Resort:
Area chart stacked by Total Slopes, Difficult Slopes, Beginner Slopes, and Intermediate Slopes highlights the terrain variety offered by each resort.

- 📍 Highest & Lowest Points by Resort:
Dual bar chart visualizes elevation extremes across resorts, showcasing which locations offer the most vertical skiing.

- ⛰️ Highest Points of Resort:
Vertical bar list of resorts with the highest elevation points, including:
- Tien Shan Ridge
- Zermatt - Matterhorn
- Telluride
- Snowmass
- Vail Crest, etc.

- 🚡 Lifts by Resort:
Clustered bar chart breakdown of Gondola Lifts, Chair Lifts, Surface Lifts, and Total Lifts across various resorts—enabling analysis of resort infrastructure capacity.


## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
- 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
- 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
- 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
- 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and  aggregation.
- Interactive Visuals: Line graphs, stacked area charts, bar charts, KPI cards
- User Experience: Drill-throughs and slicers to filter by continent, country, and resort features

## 🚀 Business Impact
- Provided travelers and tour operators with detailed resort comparisons for better planning
- Highlighted resort suitability for various skier levels (beginner to expert)
- Helped identify regions with child-friendly, night-skiing, and summer-skiing options
- Delivered a global overview of ski infrastructure and terrain types in a visually appealing format
